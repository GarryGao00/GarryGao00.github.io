# Research Experience

### Research Assistant @ [ELIPSIS Lab](https://jaynesresearchgroup.weebly.com/) (Prof. Allison Jaynes)
*Iowa City, IA | June 2022 - June 2023*
* **Topic:** Pulsating Aurora Detection using ML.
* Developed a new image acquiring and processing pipeline from THEMIS imager array to significantly accelerate the aurora video/image processing and improve quality for ML model training.
* Designed a new aurora ML classification model using a CNN-RNN hybrid architecture, automated the aurora video spatial and temporal information extraction process, and increased the precision to over 90%.

### Research Assistant @ [Eliott's Bio-inspired AI Research Lab](https://elbica.cs.grinnell.edu/start-here/)
*Grinnell, IA | June 2021 - December 2021*
* **Topic:** Moral Reasoning Modeling.
* Implemented cascading failure effects using evolutionary game theory on multiple network structures with 10,000+ agents to show the superiority of cooperative strategy in a large community.
* Simulated and investigated behaviors of empathy-driven robots trained with Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning algorithms via CoppeliaSim, Kilombo, and Webots.
